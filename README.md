# Intrusion-Detection-System
- IDS monitors a network or systems for malicious activity and protects a computer network from unauthorized access from users,including perhaps insider.
- The motive of this study is to propose a predictive model (i.e. a classifier) capable of distinguishing between 'bad connections' (intrusions/attacks) and a 'good (normal) connections' after applying some feature extraction on KDD Cup 1999 dataset by DARPA.

# DATASET
KDD Cup 1999 dataset by DARPA
The whole dataset can be downloaded from- http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html

# MODELS
- A total of seven models is trained and tested. 
- The performance of all the algorithms is examined based on accuracy and computational time. 
- Derived results show that Support Vector Machine outperforms the best on measures like Accuracy and Computational Time.

# ALGORITHMS USED
Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression,Gradient Boosting, ANN
